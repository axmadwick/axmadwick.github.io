AX MADWICK is the moniker used by Max Chadwick for his electronic and hip hop music production work. He has been making music for over 25 years. He got started in middle school, playing guitar in a rock band named Wired in his friend's basement, performing both originals and covers. Through band practice he became enthralled with the drums and wound up forming another band with the same members called Untitled where he and the drummer switched roles.

In high school he continued playing guitar and drums in various bands, but in parallel began listening to electronic music. He heard about a computer program called Fruity Loops and got hooked, often staying up late into the night composing music inspired by Aphex Twin, Squarepusher and Boards of Canada which he published under the name 'bed eternity". This passion led him to pursue a degree in Music Technology from Northeastern University where he also received classical training, taking 4 semesters in music theory and regular one on one composition lessons with his professors.

Since graduation in 2008 he has been involved in various music projects but has leaned in more to the technology side with his professional career.

In 2020 he birthed AX MADWICK as a new outlet for his work, putting a few instrumentals out on SoundCloud. In 2023 he revived the project with a reinvigorated sound. The arrangements, rhythm, harmonies and melodies draw from his diverse and extensive musical background. AX MADWICK's music straddles electronic, hip hop and pop. But rather than targeting a specific genre he prefers to produce music that just sounds good.
