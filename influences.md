# Influences

## Late Elementary / Middle School (1995 - 1999)

### Bush - Sixteen Stone

The main style of music that I started to like as I formed my own taste in music towards the end of elementary school was rock. I had many albums on CD and tape like Throwing Copper by Live and Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness by Smashing Pumpkins. However if I had to pick the most influential album of that style from that era I'd pick Sixteen Stone by Bush. Sixteen Stone definitely was one of the factors that drove me toward guitar in the guitar in the 5th grade, which was really the start of my musical journey. I can remember learning the power chords to play their songs like Machinehead with my guitar teacher John.

Beyond the music, I can also remember idolizing Gavin Rossdale. I remember walking into a barbershop with my Mom with a ripped out magazine photo of him and showing it to the barber and asking him to give me the same hair style (for whatever reason the barber told me he couldn't do it).

### Rancid - ...And Out Come the Wolves

As I got into 7th grade my taste started to shift towards punk music, with Rancid becoming my next idols.

I'm not sure of my exact age at the time, but snagged the username rancidboy on [AIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_(software)) (I can't remember if I had that exact spelling). This was around the same time that I started skateboarding and smoked my first cigarette.

## High School (1999 - 2003)

### Converge - Jane Doe

As I got into high school my taste shifted to more heavy music. Metal was fairly popular at the time with bands like Korn and Limp Bizkit being pretty mainstream, but my group of friends went the next level and got very into hardcore with bands like Converge and Dillinger Escape Plan. 

I only wanted to pick one hardcore album from this era and it's Dillinger Escape Plan's "Calculating Infinity" is a very close second place, but ultimately I think Jane Doe best captures the overall sound of what I was listening to.

### Built to Spill - Perfect From Now On

At the same time as getting into hardcore I also went in the opposite direction and got into more spacey music with bands like Spiritualized and Sigur Ros. But there was a point in time where I came to the conclusion that Perfect from Now On was the best album ever created. In fact, the name that I started associating with my music "bed eternity" actually originates from the first track of this album, "Randy Described Eternity".

### Radiohead - Kid A

While I wouldn't directly attribute Radiohead to my interest in electronic music which formed in high school, I think one of the reasons that I love(d) Kid A so much is that it straddles my roots in rock music and the electronic direction my tastes were beginning to take. I was a huge Radiohead fan in general and loved OK Computer, Amnesiac and their more straight rock background with the The Bends, but like many fans Kid A was always my favorite.

### DNTEL - Life is Full Of Possibilities

Distilling the electronic music I listened to at this time to a single choice is extremely difficult. I was very close to putting Aphex Twin's Richard D. James album on here, but ultimately landed on Life is Full Of Possiblitie by DNTEL. I had a bunch of friends that liked electronic music and this was an album that no one else seemed to really know or listen to as much as me. I was floored by the beauty of it, though. Other honorable mentions for the list are Boards of Canada (hard to pick which album) and "Yesterday Was Dramatic - Today Is OK" by Múm.

### Weezer - The Blue Album

More straight forward rock was not by any means dead to me at the time. There was all kind of rock I was listening to like At The Drive In and also some emo like Jimmy Eat World. It was an older album but I started to really appreciate Weezer's The Blue Album at this point in my life.

## College (2003 - 2008)

### Nas - Illmatic

It wasn't until college that I truly started to appreciate hip hop. The credit for this was mainly due to a friend I made in my first semester named Pat who put really put me on to it. Before that my friends and I never really took rap seriously as we had only really heard mainstream stuff which we sometimes laughed at like "Back That Azz Up" by Juvenile or "In da Club" by 50 Cent.

I can't remember exactly what pat was playing that shifted my mindset, Nas was definitely in the mix when hanging out along with other classics like Jay-Z's "Reasonable Doubt" or Mobb Deep's "The Infamous. I started listening to rap by myself and quickly realized how much a masterpiece Nas had created with Illmatic.

### The New Deal - Gone Gone Gone

College was also when I started to get into actually dancing to music. The New Deal were one of my favorite bands to go out and see live and dance to. They were a band I much preferred to listen to live rather than their albums, but I did want to capture them here as this was an important part of my musical journey and this album has many of their classic songs like VL Tone.

### Shpongle - Tales of the Inexpressible

I also got an appreciating for psychedelic trance around this time in my life. It's not a genre I listen to much in the present day, but I was a big fan of Shpongle, Hallucinogenic, Infected Mushroom and other similar acts at the time.
