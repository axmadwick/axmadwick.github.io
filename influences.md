## Elementary / Middle School

### Bush - Sixteen Stone

The main style of music that I started to like as I formed my own taste in music towards the end of elementary school was rock. I had many albums on CD and tape like Throwing Copper by Live and Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness by Smashing Pumpkins. However if I had to pick the most influential album of that style from that era I'd pick Sixteen Stone by Bush. Sixteen Stone definitely was one of the factors that drove my toward music, and playing the guitar as a kid. I can remember learning the power chords to play their songs with my guitar teacher John.

Beyond the music, I can also remember idolizing Gavin Rossdale.I can remember walking into a barbershop with my Mom with a ripped out magazine photo of him and showing it to the barber and asking him to give me the same hair style (for whatever reason he told me we couldn't do it).

### Rancid - ...And Out Come the Wolves

As I got into my teenage years my taste started to shift towards punk music, with Rancid becoming my next idols.

I'm not sure of my exact age at the time, but I had the username rancidboy on [AIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_(software)) (I can't remember if I had that exact spelling). This was around the same time that I started skateboarding and smoked my first cigarette.
