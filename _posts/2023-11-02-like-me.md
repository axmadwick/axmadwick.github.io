	<h3>The Story</h3>
	<p>
		This song was produced around an <a href="https://www.looperman.com/acapellas/detail/20422/ntj-talk-like-me-130bpm-rap-acapella">acapella that was uploaded to Looperman</a> by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/colethevii/?hl=en">Cole The VII</a> titled "NTJ Talk - Like Me". <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NTJTalk/featured">NTJ Talk</a> is his project which explores MBTI personality types.
	</p>
	<p>
		In "Like Me" we hear a back and forth between two of the personality types, the confident extrovert "ENTJ" boasting how "everyone wants to be like me", and the introvert "INTJ" telling everyone "leave me alone". The original track and video can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51NsRP61bw4">here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The beat features guitar, sliced guitar, synths and electronic drums. Most of the guitar was recorded by me in 2007. I found it in a "b-sides" directory on an old hard drive from a track that I had titled "Church for Astronauts" at the time.

	<p>
		These would have been b-sides from the album I had created back then called "The Big Day" (this was during the MySpace era so anything that was published online back then isn't working at this point).
	</p>
	<p>
		Once "Like Me" was nearly done I sent a rough mix to my friend Chris (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/ludabuddha_music/">Luda Buddah</a>) who layed down some additional fresh guitar lines which can be heard in the song's outro.
