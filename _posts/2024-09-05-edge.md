<h2>Lyrics</h2>

<h3>Intro [AX MADWICK]</h3>

<p>
They pushed me to the edge, this society<br>
Smoking on the herbs all varieties<br>
Brown drink wash away sobriety<br>
Post it live stream, no privacy
</p>

<h3>Verse 1 [#Bo]</h3>

I don’t really even really wanna hang for a change<br>
I just really wanna stay in the crib<br>
Watching Raising Kanan eating Raising Cane's with a bitch<br>
But I’m back on that low carb shit in the gym <br>
Once again, I ain’t never been slim<br> 
And never will be trust me when it comes to the raps man I’m filthy <br>
In the court not guilty<br>
I like to get tipsy on Saturdays <br>
Play some albums with the gang<br>
Waddup tho<br>
Gotta hit em with the gusto even when I feel too drained to maintain<br>
I crack 1000 watt smile<br>
Cause I’m just too next too fresh too blessed to complain<br>
Understand that<br>
Nobody really gives a fuck<br>
When your down on your luck<br>
And you tell em that you wanna give up<br>
They’ll tell you make that jump shit<br>


<h3>Verse 2 [AX MADWICK]</h3>

<p>
They got me stressed<br>
And feeling crazy<br>
Can't sleep, around the room pacing<br>
Mind racing<br>
I'm scheming<br>
Need the paper, ain't no dreaming<br>
Got demons<br>
Like skeletons<br>
In the closet, we all got secrets<br>
And regrets<br>
To confess<br>
No church, but father please bless<br>
</p>

<h3>Verse 3 [Astro Rockit]</h3>
<p>
I been waiting for a sign<br>
I just wanna know it's mine<br>
Not feeling great, feelin fine<br>
Don't wanna see inside my mind<br>
I really fight alot of pain<br>
You don't wanna hear the thoughts in my brain<br>
I been through a lotta change<br>
I could never stay the same<br>
I could never say your name<br>
Cuz it hurts can't lie<br>
I'm feeling grounded, can't fly<br>
I'm stuck on earth, can't die<br>
You know I really had love<br>
Ain't put a single thing above<br>
But that's a lesson, yeah for sure<br>
Ain't trippin bout what it was
</p>
